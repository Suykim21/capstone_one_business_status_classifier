    "### 3.1 Visualize closed and open restaurants' attributes\n",
    "- Average star rating,\n",
    "- Average price\n",
    "- Average review count\n",
    "- total count of closed and open restaurants\n",
    "\n",
    "Open businesses tend to have higher average values across the board. One interesting finding from these bargraphs are that the average review count is significantly higher for open businesses than closed businesses which makes me hypothesize that more reviews means more foot traffic to the restaurant (higher chance of remaining open), which using this feature may yield considerable weight in accurately predicting restaurant is likely to be successful during machine learning part of the project. \n",

    "### 3.2 Closed and open business count by lifespan\n",
    "Majority of the businesses fail within first 3 years; closed businesses' downward trend is more apparent compared to open businesses. Open businesses tend to have a lot more businesses spread out in all lifespan categories. \n",

    "### 3.3 Review count trend in last 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365 days\n",
    "- Scaled column values for 30 ,60 ,90 ,180 , and 365 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Both closed and open restaurants had upward trend in getting more review counts over last one year. The only difference between two is that open restaurants generally have more reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/trend_img.png\" alt=\"trend\" style=\"width: 100%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Businesses' revenues vs age\n",
    "After random sampling from open businesses, currently opened restaurants did consistently better than its closed businesses in terms of revenue. Closed restaurants had downward trend in sales as the year went on.\n",

    "### 3.5 Top 5 Cuisines and Venues\n",
    "I intentionally omitted 'American food' from cuisine and 'Restaurants' from venues as they were overwhelmingly common throughout the business dataframe. I wanted to visualize other top cuisines and venues aside from aforementioned cuisine and venue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Asian fusion and Japanese food are the most common cuisines and common venues are nightlife, bars, caes, bakeries, and pub.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cuisine_venue_img.png\" alt=\"cuisine_venue\" style=\"width: 100%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Cuisine and Venue Ranking by Average Star Rating\n",
    "Visualizing top cuisines and venues based on star rating\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/high_cuisine_img.png\" alt=\"cuisine_rating\" style=\"width: 480px; display: inline-block\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/high_venue_img.png\" alt=\"venue_rating\" style=\"width: 480px; display: inline-block\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Top 5 venues based on star rating are cheese shops, food trucks, farmers market, wineries, and bakeries; while top 5 cuisines based on star rating are hawaiian, modern european, latin american, lebanese, and vegetarian.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common correlation between those two results above are that top 5 mentioned venues and cuisines does not have significant amount of review counts compared to bottom half of the list. Therefore, generally, more reviews meant lower overall star rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Reviews' and Tips' Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Visualizing sentiment analysis score for both closed and open restaurants\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compound score is a metric that calculates the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been normalized between -1(most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "- positive sentiment : (compound score >= 0.05)\n",
    "- neutral sentiment : (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)\n",
    "- negative sentiment : (compound score <= -0.05)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/sentiment_img.png\" alt=\"sentiment\" style=\"width: 70%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/sentiment_score_img.png\" alt=\"sentiment_score\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, open restaurants have higher compound and positive sentiment scores while close restaurants have higher negative and neutral sentiment scores. Therefore, how users/customers perceive about the restaurants have some impact on whether restaurants will stay open or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 Total positive, neutral, negative review count and its average text count\n",
    "Check to how many reviews are positive, neutral, and negative. Identify average text count included in positive, neutral, and negative review.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/pos_neg_count_img.png\" alt=\"pos_neg_neu\" style=\"width: 80%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying text count through box plot to see count from 25%, 50%, and 75% quartiles\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/boxplot_img.png\" alt=\"boxplot\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Majority reviews are positive and had slightly higher average text count compared to neutral and negative reviews. It is interesting that bulk of reviews are positive; this makes me think that customers are more willing to leave reviews when they're satisfied with restaurants' service and/or food, inversely when customers are not satisfied with it, majority of the customers does not leave any feedback for restaurants to improve their service and food.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 Visualize word cloud for top 10 hightest and lowest ranked businesses\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/wordcloud_img.png\" alt=\"wordcloud\" style=\"width: 100%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering majority of the reviews are positive, there doesn't seem to be much difference between open and closed reviews. However, open review wordcloud tend to have more obvious positive adjectives compared to closed businesses' reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Prepare and create model data to be used for statistic analysis and machine learning\n",
    "- Updated Business dataframe by adding sentiment analysis score, user_review_type and updating revenue accumulated from tips and reviews dataframe.\n",
    "- Got total star rating count (star_1.0, star_2.0, etc.) per restaurant\n",
    "- Added two new columns pos_reviews and neg_reviews - which shows total positive and negative review counts for each restaurant based on comparing review's star rating and user's average rating. When star rating is higher than user's star rating, it is considered good review and vice versa.\n",
    "- Used checkins' total count to update each restaurant's revenue by multiplying checkins with restaurant's price range.\n",
    "- Define positive and negative reviews based on user average rating\n",
    "    - Every user rates differently and star ratings can be subjective; therefore, to minimize subjectivity, I am defining whether the review is positive or negative relative to user's average rating. For example, if user rated one restaurant with 2.5 but has the given average rating of 2.1 stars, I am defining as positive since its above the average.\n",
    "- Got total star rating count (star_1.0, star_2.0, etc.) per restaurant\n",
    "- Removed name, business_id, stars, and state columns from business dataframe\n",
    "- Utilized MinMaxScaler to normalize value between 0-1 to all columns to improve convergence speed during machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaned (test) dataset\n",
    "The cleaned dataset is used for statistical analysis and machine learning. It contains 39,824 rows with 158 columns. All columns have float64 datatype ranging from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'test' dataframe\n",
    "test dataframe is sparsely defined since majority of columns are restaurants' attributes and cuisines such as 'tableservice', 'drivethru', 'french', 'korean', 'casual', and etc. It also contains other added columns such as restaurants' lifespan, sentiment analysis scores, star rating count, adjusted_star (count) etc. to help predict whether restaurant is prone to failure or not.\n",
    "\n",
