    "Starting and running a successful business is a fulfilling yet incredibly challenging endeavor. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), roughly 45% of businesses fail within the first 5 years after its inception. Businesses fail due to various reasons; for instance, lack of market knowledge, bad location, little financing, bad service, and etc. With that being said, I decided to create a classification model that predicts whether the restaurant will close or remain open with given information (revenue, lifespan, review ratings, etc.).
