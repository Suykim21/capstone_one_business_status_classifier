    "## 5. Statistical Analysis\n",
    "Utilized three different statistical test methods:\n",
    "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** - Testing categorical and quantitaive Variables to determine whether is_open and lifespan columns are related\n",
    "- **Chi-Square** - Testing two categorical variables\n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation** - Testing two qunatitative variables\n",
    "\n",
    "I based my decision whether to reject null hypothesis ($H_0$) or not by following standard p-value cutoff of 0.05 or 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- p-value < $\\alpha$ (0.05) - Data providing significant evidence against the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and accept the alternate hypothesis ($H_a$). In other words, it is more than 95% likely that the association of interest would be present following repeated smaples drawn from the population.\n",
    "- p-value > $\\alpha$ (0.05) - Data do not provide enough evidence against the null hypothesis ($H_0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANOVA Testing - Categorical and Quantitative Variables\n",
    "Evaluated whether or not there's an association between restaurant's current business status (close or open - categorical variable) and how long restaurant has been operating for (lifespan - quantitative variable). I also evaluted relationship between restaurant's business status and its revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Retaurant Status and Lifespan\n",
    "- $H_0$ - Restaurant's lifespan and restaurant's business status are ***unrelated***.\n",
    "- $H_a$ - Restaurant's lifespan and restaurant's business status are ***related***.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Retaurant Status and Revenue\n",
    "- $H_0$ - Restaurant's revenues and restaurant's business status are ***unrelated***.\n",
    "- $H_a$ - Restaurant's revenues and restaurant's business status are ***related***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open and close restaurant's snapshot:\n",
    "- Open restaurants had average lifespan of **0.38** with standard deviation of **0.24**\n",
    "- Restaurants that are *closed for business* has average lifespan of **0.24** with standard deviation of **0.18**\n",
    "- Restaurants that are *open for business* has average revenue of **0.006** with standard deviation of **0.013**\n",
    "- Restaurants that are *open for business* has average revenue of **0.003** with standard deviation of **0.007**\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is true that 0.38 lifespan is more than 0.24 lifespan, it's not at all clear that this is a large enough difference to reject the null hypothesis. Or to say that restaurants with higher lifespan are more likely to be open than restaurants with low lifespan. So we ned to assess the evidence in order to determine whether the data provides srong evidence against the null hypothesis to cliam that there is no relationship between lifespan and restaurant business status (is_open)\n",

    "\n",
    "Both Anova test yielded incredibly small p-value with high F-statistics which tells us that there is an association between restaurant lifespan and business status (is_open) as well as restaurant's revenue and its business status. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chi Square Test - Two Categorical Variables\n",
    "I was curious to see if there was relationship between restaurant's business status and multiple stars columns (range from 1.0-5.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "- $H_0$ - Restaurant's lifespan and restaurant's star rating counts are ***unrelated***.\n",
    "- $H_a$ - Restaurant's lifespan and restaurant's star rating counts are ***related***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I grabbed 5 columns related to stars rating (which has count values per restaurant) and is_open column for testing. Afterwards I created contingency table which both rows and columns accumulates to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/stars_df_img.png\" alt=\"stars_df\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/stars_viz_img.png\" alt=\"star_viz\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing with chi-square, it returned high chi-squre value of **48**, and the p-value shown in scientific notation is quite small, approximately 8.7e to the negative 10, which clearly tells us that stars columns and is_open column are significantly associated. Another interesting to note is that open restaurants tend to have more positive stars (3.0-5.0) compared to close restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pearson Correlation - Two Quantitative Variables\n",
    "Earlier in this section, we found out that restaurant's revenues and its business status are associated. In other words, restaurant's revenues has some influence whether restaurants will remain open or not. I wanted to find whether revenues and sentiment's compound score has strong positive linear relationship using pearson correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $H_0$ - Restaurant's revenue and restaurant's sentiment's compound score are ***unrelated***.\n",
    "- $H_a$ - Restaurant's revenue and restaurant's sentiment's compound score are ***related***.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/linear_img.png\" alt=\"linear_reg\" style=\"width: 30%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson correlation returned correlation coefficient of approximately **0.08** with a very small p-value of 1.7e negative 57. The relationship between revenue and compound are statistically signficant with slight positive linear relationship as shown on the graph above. However, residuals (distance between data points and line) for the most part seem okay as majority of the datapoints are congested in one area but there are significant number of data points that are far from the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Statistical Analysis\n",
    "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** - Tested restaurant's lifespan and revenue (explanatory variables) and its business status (response variable) which concluded lifespan/revenue and is_open columns are associated, rejecting null hypothesis due to having very small p-value.\n",
    "- **Chi-Square** - Tested stars columns (1.0-5.0) and restaurant's lifespan which also resulted in having association, open restaurants had significantly higher ratings count.\n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation** - Tested between restaurant's revenue and its sentiment's compound score - it has slightly positive linear relationship with low p-value, most data points are congested in one area, however there are significant number of data points that has high residual value."
